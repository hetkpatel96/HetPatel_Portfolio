I believe that data tells us more than just numbers, it helps us understand our users and their desires. I wanted the businesses maximize their value with the appropriate use of data. With this dream of making a change, I moved all the way from India to United States to pursue my Master's degree in Information Systems with specializing in Business Intelligence technologies. I am looking forward to a opportuity where I can apply my technical skills for the upliftment of the company and for personal growth.
